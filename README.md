# rust-plugins
Open Source versions of Plugins I made originally for znpve.com

Many of them were built purposefully to integrate into a very customized system and not with the intention of being published or sold at any point in time.
Therefore some configuration and specific desgn decisions might be hard-coded (currently). 
The Plugins were created over the last 3 years and with them my knowledge in Plugin development evolved, so some things will also not be fully optimizes (currently)

None of the plugins utilizes the umod i18n system! (currently)

I will try and maintain, as well as improve and upgrade them as much as time permits. Feel free to contribute.

## Contribute
If you like, you can create PRs for changes and improvements you made to the plugins at any time. I am sure there will be things that need improvment ;)
