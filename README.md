![ZN Plugins](https://github.com/DocValerian/rust-plugins/blob/main/assets/ZNpve.png?raw=true)

Open Source versions of Plugins I made originally for znpve.com. **Zombie Nation PVE** used to be one of the top 300 global Rust Servers with 1000s of monthly 
users and regular pop around 100+, with no paid systems. We had to discontinue the server due to time constraints, but the custom plugins 
I wrote for the server might be of use to someone out there.

Of course, I will also not charge you anything for them. I build these as a relaxing hobby.

Many of them were built purposefully to integrate into a very customized system and not with the intention of being published or sold at any point in time.
Therefore some configuration and specific desgn decisions might be hard-coded. 
The Plugins were created over the last 4 years and with them my knowledge in Plugin development evolved, so some things will also not be fully optimized.

None of the plugins utilizes the umod i18n system!

I will try and maintain, as well as improve and upgrade them as much as time permits. Feel free to contribute.

## Plugins to be released
- None. All are either polished in their own folder, or under x_UnpolishedPlugins (18 plugins)
- They might be updated at some point, but no guarantees here.

## Discussions and Feedback
Feel free to join the [ZN Discord](https://discord.gg/8tkBFRjg3W) to contact me for discussions and feedback etc.


## Contribute
If you like, you can create PRs for changes and improvements you made to the plugins at any time. I am sure there will be things that need improvment ;)
